##### Maps page
* The map page which uses the google maps api allows users to see the locations of all mountain resorts available on each pass. On the desktop view there are three buttons location at the top of the screen that toggle markers on and off the map so you can visually compare locations for each pass.

* When a pass is toggled on (Epic Pass, Mountain Collective and Ikon Pass), markers in the corresponding color will show on the map as well as a container with a list of links to all the mountains it offers.

* Along with the ability to toggle the markers on and off the map, users can also click on the markers to show infoboxes that contain details of that resorts accessibility. When a marker is clicked the map will center and zoom in to that location.

* To improve visibility and ease of usability on mobile devices, the map has been set to take up 100% of the screen. Instead of buttons to toggle markers on and off there is a map options dropdown menu in the top corner.
